### Features

* Define uniforms with JSON which map to UI and MIDI
* Serialize shader chains and uniforms to presets
* Create texture uniforms with video, webcam, microphone, sound files, framebuffer swaps, or other passes
* Render to PNGs, encode mp4s and gifs (ffmpeg required - install [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html))
* Gif encoding supports setting number of colors and scaled resolution
* Mp4 encoding supports looping video
* Use precise duration and framerate for slick looping gifs ðŸ¤©
* Build a midi map with the UI
* Livecode by going full screen and hiding the UI (bring your own editor)
