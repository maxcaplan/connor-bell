# Feedback

## 2017

I use additively blended framebuffers (aka feedback loops) in most of my work since I discovered them. They use what was rendered in the previous frame to color the current. I wrote a blog post about this here, [“Controlling the Entropy of Feedback Loops”](https://docs.lost.show/blog/feedbackloops/).
