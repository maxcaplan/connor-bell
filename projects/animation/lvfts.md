# lvfts

## 2016

Created with a combination of techniques. It started with a menger sponge with animated parameters to change the size of the subtractive geometry. I used my floor position offset technique for some and fOpUnionStairs and fModPolar from Mercuryâ€™s [hg_sdf](http://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf) library.
