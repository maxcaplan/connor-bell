# orbs

## 2017

Space looks very orb like when you apply a fisheye to it. Fisheye created by [Cale](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsySW1). A few of these tessellations have opposite z translations on each of their signs (+ or -). For example, the z axis below y = 0 translates toward the camera where the z axis on top scrolls away.
