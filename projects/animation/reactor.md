## 2016

This is when I learned if you negate a signed distance field, you will draw the inside. Most of these structures are bounded by an inside-out sphere. I also used Mercuryâ€™s [hg_sdf library](http://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf/) for the fOpUnionStairs function, which joins two signed distance fields with stairs.
