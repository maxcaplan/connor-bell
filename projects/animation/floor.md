# Floor

## 2016

I wrote about this technique on my blog [here](http://connorbell.ca/2017/04/10/raymarching.html). It collapses the floating point space into cells with the floor function, and then uses that value to offset the position at a different phase in the animation.

{% include gallery.html path="/assets/images/gifs/collections/floor/" %}

<script src="/assets/js/lightbox-gallery.js"></script>
