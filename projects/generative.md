Update June 2021: I’ve started posting sketches on [https://shaders.connorbell.ca](https://shaders.connorbell.ca). These interactive WebGL shaders are automatically deployed from my software, ShaderChain.

I regularly create code sketches to learn new ideas, inspire larger concepts and to document my process. I’ve made over 400 since 2015 using a technique called [raymarching](http://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/) to render signed distance fields. This allows flexibility beyond the regular constraints of 3d models and opens up possibilities to render complex fractals, infinite lattices, etc.
