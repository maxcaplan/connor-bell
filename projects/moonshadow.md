![Banner]({{absolute_url}}/assets/images/moonshadow/banner.png)

## Platform: iOS, Android

**Language** GLSL, Objective-C, Java

**Status** Discontinued but maybe back in some form some day.

I wanted to make something free, open source and collaborative. I invited shader artists [Cale Bradbury](http://twitter.com/netgrind), [Devin Horsman](http://twitter.com/horsman), [Yancy Way](http://twitter.com/echophons) and [Rob Butler](http://twitter.com/botreats) to create effects for the applications. Each shader could be masked to colors of the input image, parameterized by a threshold.
